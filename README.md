### **Apple Pay: Taking on Credit Card Companies:**
Apple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service supported in the apple ecosystem. It is highly successful processing over 1 billion transactions in the second quarter of 2018. Itâ€™s competitors are companies such as square, PayPal, Zelle, venmo, etc. Apple was founded in 1976 as a computer company, it now has found various ways to have computers applied to different functions such as watches, mobile devices, speakers, etc.

ApplePay "is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Apple Inc. that allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web using Safari. It is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac." (5) 

ApplePay is aimed at a financial service (payments), and it utilizes technology to execute/provide a solution for the trageted financial service (payment). Therefore, it is a Fintech service. More specifically, "Apple Pay (sic) uses the EMV Payment Tokenisation Specication." (5)

Apple Pay's strenghts are its flexibility and the technology used to support its payments.  Apple Pay allows users to store credit cards and pay at available retailers without the need of the physical credit card. Additionally, Apple Pay has the flexibility to allow purchases even when there is no internet (1).

One of the main weaknesses of Apple Pay is the limisted support for online purchases.  To use Apply Pay On-line, a user needs to use Safari web browser on a Mac, iPhone or iPad (1) and Mac only represents approximately 15% of the OS market share (2). With such a low market share for personal computers it will be difficult for Apple to maintain growth and competitveness, however, that may be somewhat offset by the fact that more and more purchases are being made via phone, where Apple has a much greater market share (3).
Another weakness of Apple Pay is its acceptance.  Currently Apple Pay is only available at 85% of retailers in the US (1), due to the special technology reader required for its use and its availablity is even more restricted internationally (4), but as with the first point, this conern may be reduced over time due to increasing proliferation of technology around the globe.
